# AuroraAI Core Components
## Overview
The National Artificial Intelligence Programme AuroraAI is based on the strategic objective of building a dynamic 
and thriving Finland expressed in Prime Minister Marinâ€™s Government Programme. 
The AuroraAI network developed in the programme will promote smoothly running daily life and business securely and 
in an ethically sustainable manner.

The Digital and Population Data Services Agency (The Finnish Digital Agency) is responsible for the implementation 
and maintenance of the core components of the AuroraAI network.
The Finnish Digital Agency will implement a technical platform that 
forms the backbone network of artificial intelligence.

The purpose of this repository is to publish the source code of the AuroraAI core components as open source.
The source code is published for evaluation and reference purposes only. 
The Finnish Digital Agency does not provide support for building or running these services outside
the agency.
